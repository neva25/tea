It is only in the recent past that Basil seed benefits have been recognized. Basil seeds, as the name suggests, are the seeds from a basil plant. Though the plant and its leaves are aromatic, seeds however are relatively flavorless.

Nutritional Powerhouse: Basil seeds are rich in plant compounds including flavonoids and other polyphenols that have anti-inflammatory properties, are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, and are prebiotic, so they can help repopulate the micro-biome.

Weight Management wonder: In addition to having a stellar nutritional profile, basil seeds are believed by some to have appetite suppressing properties. This should come as no surprise as they pack a sizable amount of fiber into just one tablespoon and expand in size in water. This makes them extra filling as they take up additional space, for the same number of calories, in our stomachs. They’re also a zero net carb food, so they work to fill you up without taking up space in your glycogen stores.

Soak Them: The big thing with basil seeds is that you need to soak them (usually in water, but you can use almond milk or another liquid of your choice) before consuming. This is also what makes them so cool though, they don’t take long to absorb water and grow in size.  And when they do absorb water, they still retain a bit of a crunchiness.
